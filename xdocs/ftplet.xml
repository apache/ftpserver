        <section name="Overview">
            <p>The Ftplet API is a simple API used to handle different FTP Server
               notifications. Apache FTP Server is a Ftplet container, allowing
               administrators to deploy Ftplet to carry out a variety of complex
               FTP event handler tasks.
            </p>
            <p>Implementing a custom Ftplet is generally a simple task, most of
               whose complexity lies in coding the actual work to be done by the
               Ftplet. This is largely due to the simplicity of the Ftplet interface
               and the fact that a DefaultFtplet class is provided as part of the
               Ftplet package.
            </p>
            <p>The Ftplet interface supports two lifecycle methods to provide
               initialization (the init() method) and shutdown (the destroy() method).
               Main processing is done in different notification methods, which take
               a FtpRequest object and a FtpResponse object. All the notification
               methods return FtpletEnum object to indicate the future action.
            </p>
            <p>There will be one instance of Ftplet object. Notification methods will
               be called from different connections running in different threads. So
               Ftplet implementation has to be thread-safe. Each connection will have
               its own request (FtpRequest) and response (FtpResponse) objects. So
               FtpRequest and FtpRestonse objects are connection specific.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section name="Main Classes">
            <subsection name="FtpletEnum">
                <p>This class encapsulates the return values of the ftplet methods.
                   There are four static FtpletEnum values.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>RET_DEFAULT</strong> : This return value indicates
                        that the next ftplet method will be called. If no other ftplet
                        is available, the FTP server will process the request.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>RET_NO_FTPLET</strong> : This return value indicates
                        that the other ftplet methods will not be called but the
                        FTP server will continue processing this request.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>RET_SKIP</strong> : It indicates that the FTP server
                        will skip everything. No further processing (both ftplet and server)
                        will be done for this request.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>RET_DISCONNECT</strong> : It indicates that the server
                        will skip and disconnect the client. No other request from the
                        same client will be served.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>So, RET_DEFAULT &lt; RET_NO_FTPLET &lt; RET_SKIP &gt; RET_DISCONNECT</p>
                <p>If the Ftplet returns null, RET_DEFAULT is assumed.</p>
            </subsection>

            <subsection name="FtpRequest">
                <p>It provides the client request information to a ftplet. Ftplet
                   notification methods will always get the same instance of FtpRequest
                   for one connection. So the attributes set by <em>setAttribute()</em>
                   will be always available later unless that attribute is removed.
                   Different connections will have different FtpRequest objects. From
                   here we can get user information, data streams, FTP command, argument,
                   user file system view etc.
                </p>
            </subsection>

            <subsection name="FtpResponse">
                <p>Ftplets can use this to send custom code and messges to client.</p>
            </subsection>

            <subsection name="Ftplet">
                <p>There will be only one instance of Ftplet. During startup the Ftplets
                   will be initialized. The initialization sequence is same as the Ftplet
                   sequence in the configuration. Then all notification methods will be
                   called and when the FTP server goes down, the Ftplet will be destroyed.
                   The following method describes all the notification methods.

                            The FTP session will be disconnected in the return value is

                            In this case, the server will skip the command processing and the

                            data transfer, the method has to notify the client with a response 
                            code 226. In case of any error, the method should send different
                            response codes like 450, 425, 426, 551.

        <section name="Configuration">
            <p>First of all, we have to decide a descriptive name for a Ftplet.
               We specify all the Ftplet names (comma separated) in
               <em>config.ftplets</em> configuration parameter. The Ftplet name
               must not contain any whitespace character, comma or semicolon. If
               we have three Ftplets (say f1, f2 and f3), the configuration will
               look like:
            </p>
            <source>
              config.ftplets=f1,f2,f3
            </source>
            <p>The next thing is to specify the fully qualified Ftplet class name.
               if in the above case the class name of the Ftplet f1 is
               &quot;com.yourdomain.Ftplet1&quot; the configuration will be:
            </p>
            <source>
              config.ftplet.f1.class=com.yourdomain.Ftplet1
            </source>
            <p>Similarly, you can add other Ftplet specific configuration
               parameters.
            </p>
            <source>
              config.ftplet.f1.param1=val1
              config.ftplet.f1.param2=val2

            <ol>
                <li>Modify your system CLASSPATH environment variable to include
