        <section name="FTP Server Logging">
            <p>FTP Server uses <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/logging">
               Commons Logging</a> throughout its internal code allowing the developer
               to choose a logging configuration that suits their needs, e.g
               java.util.logging or <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j">Log4J</a>.
               Commons Logging provides FTP Server the ability to log hierarchially
               across various log levels without needing to rely on a particular
               logging implementation.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section name="log4j">
            <p>If you need to setup detailed logging from within FTP Server's code,
               then you can use a simple log4j configuration. Note that this logging
               can be very verbose depending on the log level you chose to use. The
               log4j jar is bundled with the binary distribution. This is an optional
               jar file. If you remove this jar file, other logging implementation
               will be autometically selected by the commons-logging.
            </p>
            <p>The log4j configuration file location is
               &lt;INSTALL_DIR&gt;/common/classes/log4j.properties. You can modify
               this file to configure log4j.
            </p>
            <source>
   log4j.rootLogger=DEBUG, R
   log4j.appender.R=org.apache.log4j.RollingFileAppender
   log4j.appender.R.File=./res/log/log.gen
   log4j.appender.R.MaxFileSize=10MB
   log4j.appender.R.MaxBackupIndex=10
   log4j.appender.R.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
   log4j.appender.R.layout.ConversionPattern=[%5p] %d %m%n
            </source>
            <p>This log4j configuration sets up a file called log.gen in your
               FTP Server ./res/log folder with a maximum file size of 10MB
               and up to 10 backups. DEBUG log level is specified.
            </p>
            <p>you should consult the
               <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs/documentation.html">log4j
               documentation</a> for more options.

        <section name="java.util.logging">
            <p>In order to configure JDK logging you should have JDK 1.4+. In the JDK's
               logging.properties file. Check your JAVA_HOME environment setting to see
               which JDK FTP Server is using. The file will be in $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib.
               Alternately, it can also use a global configuration file located elsewhere
               by using the system property java.util.logging.config.file, or programmatic
               configuration using java.util.logging.config.class.
            </p>
            <p>The default logging.properties specifies a ConsoleHandler for routing
               logging to stdout and also a FileHandler. A handler's log level threshold
               can be set using SEVERE, CONFIG, INFO, WARN, FINE, FINEST or ALL. The
               logging.properties shipped with JDK is set to INFO. Please refer to Sun's
               java.util.logging documentation for the complete details.
